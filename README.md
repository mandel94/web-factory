:bulb: The idea is to use JavaScript to produce parameterized html snippets ready to be copy-pasted in a html file. 
This would allow to use html in a programmatic way, adding to:
* the *reproducibility* of web design...
* and its *flexibility*, thanks to JavaScript functions and their parameters;

Moreover, by putting constrainsts on some parameters, we could easily get standardized code snippets.
